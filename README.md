## Build
This [Java 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) project uses the [Gradle 5](https://gradle.org/) build tool to automatically download dependencies and build the project from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/dtm
cd dtm
gradlew build
```
**Note**: If you do not already have Gradle installed, it will be installed automatically by the wrapper script included in the source

**Note**: Jefferson Lab has an intercepting [proxy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/92c25a033db93a90184a5994e71d0b78)

## Configure

### Environment Variables
Uses the [Smoothness Environment Variables](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/smoothness#environment-variables).

### Database
The Downtime application requires an Oracle 18 database with the following [schema](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/dtm/tree/main/schema) installed.   The application server hosting the Downtime app must also be configured with a JNDI datasource.

## Install
   1. Download [Wildfly 16](https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/)
   1. Download [dtm.war](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/dtm/releases) and deploy it to Wildfly
   1. Navigate your web browser to localhost:8080/dtm

**Note:** dtm presumably works with any Java EE 8 compatible server such as [GlassFish](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/) or [TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org/).

**Note:** The dependency jars (except Java EE 8 jars required to be available in the server) are included in the _war_ file that is generated by the build by default, but you can optionally exclude them (if you intend to install them into your application server) with the flag _-Pprovided_ like so:
```
gradlew -Pprovided build
```
